{"name":"Dogetips","tagline":"Dogecoin integration with your Minecraft server.","body":"# Hello shibe!\r\n## Welcome to _DogeTips_, an easy way to integrate Dogecoins into your Minecraft server!\r\n## Let's take a look at what this plugin currently has to offer...  \r\n### What are the commands?\r\nThere's only one command that you will have to remember:! '**/doge**' contains all the nifty sub-commands your players may use to interact with DogeTips. You can use a sub-command with '**/doge _(sub-command)_**'\r\n### Alright, what are these 'sub-commands'?\r\nGlad you asked! Here are the current sub-commands and their usage (substitute \"you\" with whoever is sending this command):\r\n* /doge **help** <_page number_>: Informs you about this plugin and how to use it.\r\n* /doge **deposit**: Will give you an address that you should deposit coins to. Use this to add coins into your Minecraft wallet.\r\n* /doge **withdraw** <_amount_> <_address_>: Will remove your in-game Dogecoins and send them to the specified address!\r\n* /doge **check**: Will force the game to check and see if your Dogecoin deposit transaction went through. Be patient as this may take some time depending on the speed of the block chain :)\r\n* /doge **jar**: Provides a statement informing you of your stored Dogecoins.\r\n* /doge **tip** <_player_> <_amount_>: Last, but _certainly_ not least: tip other players in Dogecoin!\r\n\r\n## I have no idea how to do this. Help me?\r\nFear not! It's not that difficult if we take it step by step.  \r\n1. Download the latest version of DogeTips from the [Bukkit page](http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/dogetips/).  \r\n2. You should now have a _.jar_ file. Drag 'n drop this into your server's /plugins folder.  \r\n3. Start up your server and then stop it. You may also _/reload_ the server if you wish (be careful as reloading is known to cause errors in some other plugins).  \r\n3. Go back into your /plugins folder. Double-click on the new folder entitled _DogeTips_.  \r\n4. Open the file _config.yml_ into your favorite text editor. Move onto the section titled _Let's configure_! (config.yml).  \r\n\r\n## Let's configure! (config.yml)\r\nWhen you open the config.yml for the first time you should get something similar to below. If you ever make a huge mistake with the config, you can just delete it and reload your server to generate a new one.  \r\n```\r\n\t#Set this to true if you wish to integrate DogeTips with an existing economy plugin that uses Vault.\r\n\tuse-vault-economy: false\r\n\t\r\n\t#Ignored if use-vault-economy is true.\r\n\tseparate-economy:\r\n\t  balance-file-name: 'balances.csv'\r\n\t\r\n\t#API configuration.\r\n\tapi:\r\n\t  api-key: \"YOUR_API_KEY_HERE\"\r\n\t  base-url: \"https://block.io/api/v1/\"\r\n\t  api-key-query: \"/?api_key=\"\r\n\t\r\n\t#Plugin colors. Use an ampersand for formatting codes if you wish.\r\n\tcolors:\r\n\t  primary: '&e'\r\n\t  secondary: '&7'\r\n\t  errors: '&c'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Nodes (or everything ending in a colon):\r\n**use-vault-economy**: This must be true or false. If true, DogeTips will use an existing economy that is already on your server. The Vault plugin must be in your plugins folder if you enable this. If this is false, then DogeTips will use its own economy that does not need Vault.  \r\n**balance-file-name**: This is the file name that is used to store Dogecoin balances for all players if the node use-vault-economy is set to false.  \r\n**api-key**: Replace this with your API key found on Block.io.  \r\n**base-url** and **api-key-query**: Do not worry about these for now. In the case that block.io removes v1 support, this URL should be changed.  \r\n**colors**: You can change the colors of the plugin's messages. It uses the standard Minecraft color code system.\r\n\r\n## Need additional help or a feature?
